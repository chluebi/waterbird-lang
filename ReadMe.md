# Waterbird

> You know those videos of herons eating snakes? 

Waterbird is another toy language of mine, intended for maximum useability for me to solve algorithmic problems quickly (coding speed, not execution speed).


### Disclaimer
I use LLMs in the process of developing this, both as rubber duckies, automation of boilerplate but also to write core logic. 
Estimate: ~10% of this repositories code stems directly from Gemini (and maybe ~1% ChatGPT), although basically everything was adjusted over time.
